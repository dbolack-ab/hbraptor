# hbRaptor

This is a relatively simple userscript for submitting rendered Homebrewery views to DocRaptor for PDF production.

To use, select the print page for your brew. Along the right side of the frame you will have a button for a "test"


When first run, it will query for an API key.

Please note that the API from DocRaptor is not particularly responsive with large documents and it can take a spell.
